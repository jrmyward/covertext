# PRD: Marketing Page Improvements for Launch

## Introduction

Refine CoverText's public marketing pages to achieve launch clarity, trust, and simplicity. This work focuses exclusively on unauthenticated public pages—no application logic, billing integration, or admin UI changes are included.

The goal is to ensure first-time visitors (independent insurance agency owners) can quickly understand what CoverText does, who it's for, how much it costs, and how to get started.

## Goals

- Present a consistent, professional public-facing experience across all marketing pages
- Communicate transparent, tiered pricing with clear value propositions
- Build trust through honest, non-hyperbolic copy
- Reduce friction for first-time visitors exploring the product

## Functional Requirements

- **FR-001:** ✅ Add a global header component to all public marketing pages with CoverText wordmark (left), "Sign In" link (right), and "Get Started" button (right)
- **FR-002:** ⚠️ Replace remaining instances of "Pilot" language in signup flow with "Free Trial" terminology
- **FR-003:** ✅ Display 3-tier pricing (Starter $49, Professional $99, Enterprise $199) with monthly/yearly toggle, clear feature differentiation, and "Save 20%" annual discount
- **FR-004:** ✅ Refine hero subheadline and marketing copy for clarity, professionalism, and accuracy
- **FR-005:** ✅ Update "What CoverText Does NOT Do" section to clarify billing terminology and maintain explicit product boundaries
- **FR-006:** ✅ Add footer navigation with "Contact", "Privacy Policy", and "Terms of Service" links on all public pages
- **FR-007:** ✅ Adjust compliance/trust language to avoid legal overclaims while maintaining professional credibility
- **FR-008:** ❌ Pass selected pricing tier from marketing page CTAs to signup flow via URL parameter
- **FR-009:** ❌ Update signup page to display selected tier and remove manual plan selection
- **FR-010:** ❌ Configure Stripe with 3 pricing tiers (Starter/Professional/Enterprise) and map to subscription creation flow

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- No demo scheduling flow or contact forms (Enterprise uses "Contact Sales" placeholder)
- No testimontier enforcement beyond Stripe subscription (honor system for limits)
- No graphic logo design work (text wordmark only)
- No major visual redesign—reuse existing Tailwind/DaisyUI components
- No billing admin UI changes (can update post-launch)s where appropriate)
- No backend pricing tier enforcement (billing logic remains single-tier for now)
- No graphic logo design work (text wordmark only)
- No major visual redesign—reuse existing Tailwind/DaisyUI components

## Design Considerations

- Reuse existing Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI component system
- Text-based "CoverText" wordmark is sufficient (no graphic logo)
- Mobile responsiveness required for all changes
- Header is visually lightweight with sticky positioning
- Maintain existing page layout structure
- Pricing components (UI::PricingCardComponent, UI::PricingSectionComponent) support rich styling options

## Technical Considerations

- Marketing page changes are frontend/view-only (ERB templates, ViewComponents)
- No database migrations required for marketing pages
- No controller or model changes for marketing pages
- Shared header/footer exist in application.html.erb layout
- Routes for login and signup already exist
- Pricing display uses CSS `group-has-[[value=yearly]:checked]` selectors for toggle functionality
- ViewComponents follow established patterns (UI::CardComponent, UI::SectionComponent, etc.)

## Success Metrics

- First-time visitors understand what CoverText does, who it's for, how much it costs, and how to get started within 10 seconds
- Public pages feel trustworthy to insurance agency owners
- Clear understanding of 3 pricing tiers and when to choose each
- No confusion about "Pilot" vs "Free Trial" language
- Visitors can click a pricing tier's CTA and sign up for that specific tier without re-selecting
- Stripe subscription created with correct price ID for selected tier

## Implementation Notes

### Tier Selection Flow
1. User clicks "Get Started" on Professional tier pricing card
2. Marketing page redirects to `/signup?plan=professional`
3. Signup page reads plan parameter, displays "Start Your Free Trial - Professional Plan"
4. On form submit, registration controller maps "professional" → Stripe price ID for Professional tier
5. Stripe subscription created, user redirected to admin dashboard

### Stripe Price ID Mapping
```ruby
# app/controllers/registrations_controller.rb
def stripe_price_id_for_plan(plan)
  case plan
  when "starter"
    Rails.application.credentials.dig(:stripe, :starter_price_id)
  when "professional"
    Rails.application.credentials.dig(:stripe, :professional_price_id)
  when "enterprise"
    Rails.application.credentials.dig(:stripe, :enterprise_price_id)
  else
    Rails.application.credentials.dig(:stripe, :starter_price_id) # default
  end
end
```

### Stripe Configuration Required
Create products and prices in Stripe dashboard or via API:
- **Starter Plan:** $49/month (price_starter_monthly) and $490/year (price_starter_yearly)
- **Professional Plan:** $99/month (price_pro_monthly) and $950/year (price_pro_yearly)
- **Enterprise Plan:** $199/month (price_ent_monthly) and $1990/year (price_ent_yearly)

Store price IDs in Rails credentials:
```yaml
stripe:
  starter_price_id: price_xxx
  professional_price_id: price_xxx
  enterprise_price_id: price_xxx
```

Note: Marketing page toggle shows monthly/yearly prices, but Stripe integration currently uses monthly pricing only. Annual billing can be added in a future iteration.
- Do we need to enforce tier limits in backend logic, or keep it honor-system for now?
