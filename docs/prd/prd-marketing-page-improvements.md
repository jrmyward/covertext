# PRD: Marketing Page Improvements for Launch

## Status Summary

**Overall Status:** ✅ **Launch Ready** (with 1 minor admin UI issue)

**Last Updated:** February 4, 2026

### Completed (8/8 User Stories)
- ✅ US-001: Global public header with navigation
- ✅ US-003: Refined hero and marketing copy
- ✅ US-004: "What CoverText Does NOT Do" section clarity
- ✅ US-005: Consistent footer navigation
- ✅ US-006: Compliance/trust language refinement
- ✅ US-007: Tier selection flow from marketing to signup
- ✅ US-008: Stripe 3-tier pricing configuration (monthly + yearly)

### Partially Complete (1/8 User Stories)
- ⚠️ US-002: "Pilot" language removed from public pages, but admin billing page still shows old plan names

### Known Issues

**Admin UI (Cosmetic):**
- Admin billing page (`app/views/admin/billing/show.html.erb`) displays outdated "Pilot" and "Growth" plan cards
- This is admin-only UI and does not affect customer-facing signup or subscription functionality
- Can be addressed in a future admin UI refresh

**Development Workflow (Fixed):**
- ~~`bin/ci` was calling `bin/setup` which destroyed development database with `db:seed`~~
- ✅ **FIXED:**
  - `config/ci.rb`: Changed from `bin/setup --skip-server` to `bin/rails db:test:prepare` (only touches test DB)
  - `bin/setup`: Changed from `db:create db:schema:load db:seed` to `db:prepare` (idempotent, no seed)
- To seed manually: `bin/rails db:seed`
- To reset: `bin/setup --reset` or `bin/rails db:reset`
- Normal workflow: `bin/ci` no longer affects development data

## Introduction

Refine CoverText's public marketing pages to achieve launch clarity, trust, and simplicity. This work focuses exclusively on unauthenticated public pages—no application logic, billing integration, or admin UI changes are included.

The goal is to ensure first-time visitors (independent insurance agency owners) can quickly understand what CoverText does, who it's for, how much it costs, and how to get started.

## Goals

- Present a consistent, professional public-facing experience across all marketing pages
- Communicate transparent, tiered pricing with clear value propositions
- Build trust through honest, non-hyperbolic copy
- Reduce friction for first-time visitors exploring the product

## Functional Requirements

- **FR-001:** ✅ Add a global header component to all public marketing pages with CoverText wordmark (left), "Sign In" link (right), and "Get Started" button (right)
- **FR-002:** ⚠️ Replace remaining instances of "Pilot" language (admin billing page still shows old plans)
- **FR-003:** ✅ Display 3-tier pricing (Starter $49, Professional $99, Enterprise $199) with monthly/yearly toggle, clear feature differentiation, and "Save 20%" annual discount
- **FR-004:** ✅ Refine hero subheadline and marketing copy for clarity, professionalism, and accuracy
- **FR-005:** ✅ Update "What CoverText Does NOT Do" section to clarify billing terminology and maintain explicit product boundaries
- **FR-006:** ✅ Add footer navigation with "Contact", "Privacy Policy", and "Terms of Service" links on all public pages
- **FR-007:** ✅ Adjust compliance/trust language to avoid legal overclaims while maintaining professional credibility
- **FR-008:** ✅ Pass selected pricing tier from marketing page CTAs to signup flow via URL parameter (plan + interval)
- **FR-009:** ✅ Update signup page to display selected tier with billing interval toggle
- **FR-010:** ✅ Configure Stripe with 3 pricing tiers (Starter/Professional/Enterprise) with monthly/yearly intervals and map to subscription creation flow

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- No demo scheduling flow or contact forms (Enterprise uses "Contact Sales" placeholder)
- No testimonials or social proof (can add when available)
- No backend pricing tier enforcement beyond Stripe subscription (honor system for limits)
- No graphic logo design work (text wordmark only)
- No major visual redesign—reuse existing Tailwind/DaisyUI components
- Billing admin UI updates deferred (still shows old "Pilot"/"Growth" plans)

## Design Considerations

- Reuse existing Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI component system
- Text-based "CoverText" wordmark is sufficient (no graphic logo)
- Mobile responsiveness required for all changes
- Header is visually lightweight with sticky positioning
- Maintain existing page layout structure
- Pricing components (UI::PricingCardComponent, UI::PricingSectionComponent) support rich styling options

## Technical Considerations

- Marketing page changes are frontend/view-only (ERB templates, ViewComponents)
- No database migrations required for marketing pages
- No controller or model changes for marketing pages
- Shared header/footer exist in application.html.erb layout
- Routes for login and signup already exist
- Pricing display uses CSS `group-has-[[value=yearly]:checked]` selectors for toggle functionality
- ViewComponents follow established patterns (UI::CardComponent, UI::SectionComponent, etc.)

## Success Metrics

- ✅ First-time visitors understand what CoverText does, who it's for, how much it costs, and how to get started within 10 seconds
- ✅ Public pages feel trustworthy to insurance agency owners
- ✅ Clear understanding of 3 pricing tiers and when to choose each
- ⚠️ Minimal confusion about "Pilot" language (only appears in admin billing page, not public-facing)
- ✅ Visitors can click a pricing tier's CTA and sign up for that specific tier without re-selecting
- ✅ Stripe subscription created with correct price ID for selected tier (monthly or yearly)
- ✅ `plan_tier` stored on Account for future feature gating

## Implementation Notes

### Tier Selection Flow (✅ Implemented)
1. User clicks "Get Started" on Professional tier pricing card
2. Marketing page redirects to `/signup?plan=professional&interval=yearly`
3. Signup page reads parameters, displays "Sign up for the Professional Plan" with billing toggle
4. User can switch between monthly/yearly on signup page (toggle updates price display)
5. On form submit, registration controller maps `plan + interval` → Stripe price ID (e.g., `professional_yearly_price_id`)
6. Stripe checkout session created with correct price ID and metadata
7. After payment, webhook updates Account with `plan_tier` and `subscription_status`
8. User auto-logged in and redirected to admin dashboard

### Stripe Price ID Mapping (✅ Implemented)
```ruby
# app/controllers/registrations_controller.rb
def stripe_price_id_for_plan(plan, interval = :yearly)
  # Build credential key: starter_monthly_price_id, professional_yearly_price_id, etc.
  key = "#{plan}_#{interval}_price_id".to_sym
  Rails.application.credentials.dig(:stripe, key) ||
    Rails.application.credentials.dig(:stripe, :starter_yearly_price_id)
end
```

### Stripe Configuration (✅ Complete)
Created products and prices in Stripe:
- **Starter Plan:**
  - `starter_monthly_price_id`: $49/month
  - `starter_yearly_price_id`: $490/year (20% savings)
- **Professional Plan:**
  - `professional_monthly_price_id`: $99/month
  - `professional_yearly_price_id`: $950/year (20% savings)
- **Enterprise Plan:**
  - `enterprise_monthly_price_id`: $199/month
  - `enterprise_yearly_price_id`: $1990/year (20% savings)

Price IDs stored in Rails credentials as documented in `docs/CREDENTIALS_SETUP.md`.

### Tier Storage and Feature Gating (✅ Implemented)

**Implemented approach: Option B (Store tier locally)**

Migration completed: `add_column :accounts, :plan_tier, :string, default: "starter", null: false`

Account model uses enum:
```ruby
enum :plan_tier, { starter: "starter", professional: "professional", enterprise: "enterprise" },
     default: :starter
```

Implementation flow (✅ Complete):
1. **Signup:** Stripe checkout session includes `metadata: { plan_tier: "professional" }`
2. **Webhook:** `subscription.updated` extracts `plan_tier` from metadata, updates Account
3. **Fallback:** If metadata missing, webhook maps price ID → tier using reverse lookup
4. **Feature checks:** Use `current_account.plan_tier` for instant lookups (no API calls)

Tier-based features (documented for future implementation):
- **Starter:** 1 active agency, basic SMS features
- **Professional:** Up to 3 active agencies, custom branding, priority support
- **Enterprise:** Unlimited agencies, API access, dedicated account manager

**Note:** Feature enforcement (agency limits, feature flags) will be implemented in a separate PRD. This PRD established the tier storage infrastructure.
