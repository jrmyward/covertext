      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">About This SMS Program</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        CoverText (operated by Workhorse Solutions, LLC) provides an SMS-based messaging service that enables independent insurance agencies to respond to customer service requests via text message. This program is designed for <strong>customer-initiated, transactional communications only</strong> — not for marketing or promotional messages.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        When you text your insurance agency's CoverText-enabled phone number, you can receive:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Insurance ID cards and policy documents</li>
        <li>Policy expiration dates and coverage information</li>
        <li>Confirmation and status update messages</li>
        <li>Clarification prompts if we need more information</li>
        <li>Error or fallback messages if your request cannot be automated</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How to Opt In</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        You opt in to receive SMS messages from your insurance agency by:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Initiating a text message conversation</strong> to your agency's CoverText-enabled phone number, OR</li>
        <li><strong>Providing your mobile number</strong> through an agency intake form, application, or website that includes SMS consent language</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="bg-base-200 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
        <p class="mb-2"><strong>Note:</strong> Your insurance agency will present clear consent language at the point where your phone number is collected. By texting the agency's number or providing your mobile number with consent, you agree to receive service-related SMS messages.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="mb-4">
        When you first text your agency's CoverText number, you will receive an automated opt-in confirmation message explaining how the service works and how to opt out.
