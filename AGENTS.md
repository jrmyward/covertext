# CoverText Agent Guide

## Context
CoverText is a Rails 8 B2B SaaS for SMS-based insurance client service. The text conversation IS the user interface. Deterministic logic only (no AI/LLMs).

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
- **Account** → top-level billing entity (has Stripe subscription)
- **Agency** → belongs to Account, represents insurance agency tenant
- **User** → belongs to Account (NOT Agency), can be 'owner' or 'admin'
- **Client** → belongs to Agency, represents insurance client
- Each Account can have multiple Agencies (active/inactive)
- Agencies are the tenant boundary for operational data (clients, policies, requests)

## Phase Discipline
- Implement only the current phase scope.
- Do not ship future-phase features early.
- Add tests required for the phase only.
- Stop once tests pass.

## Stack Rules
- Rails 8 + PostgreSQL.
- Hotwire (Turbo; Stimulus only if needed).
- Importmap-only (no Node/bundlers).
- Tailwind CSS via tailwindcss-rails + DaisyUI.
- ActiveStorage for documents.
- Solid Queue/Cache/Cable (SQLite for non-primary DBs).
- Minitest only (no RSpec).
- ViewComponent + Heroicon for reusable UI.

## Data Model Patterns

### Account Model
- Handles Stripe billing: `stripe_customer_id`, `stripe_subscription_id`, `subscription_status`, `plan_name`
- Validations: stripe IDs are `unique: true, allow_nil: true`
- subscription_status uses inclusion validation with allowed values
- Key methods: `subscription_active?`, `has_active_agency?`, `can_access_system?`, `owner`
- `has_many :agencies`, `has_many :users`

### Agency Model
- Represents insurance agency tenant
- Belongs to Account: `belongs_to :account`
- Has operational data: `has_many :clients`, `has_many :policies`, `has_many :requests`
- Key fields: `phone_sms` (Twilio number), `active` (boolean)
- Key methods: `can_go_live?`, `activate!`, `deactivate!`
- Does NOT have `has_many :users` (users belong to Account)

### User Model
- Belongs to Account: `belongs_to :account` (NOT `belongs_to :agency`)
- Roles: 'owner' (one per account) or 'admin'
- Use `ROLES` constant for role validation

### Client Model (was Contact)
- Belongs to Agency: `belongs_to :agency`
- Phone field: `phone_mobile` (E.164 format)
- Represents insurance agency clients who text for service

### Naming Conventions
- Use "Client" not "Contact" for insurance clients
- Use `phone_mobile` for client phone numbers
- Use `phone_sms` for agency Twilio numbers

## Controller Patterns

### Helper Methods (Always Use These)
```ruby
# ApplicationController
current_user      # Returns authenticated User
current_account   # Returns current_user&.account

# Admin::BaseController (inherits ApplicationController)
current_agency    # Returns current_user.account.agencies.where(active: true).first
```

**Never duplicate this logic.** Always use the helpers.

### Access Control
- `require_active_subscription` before_action in Admin::BaseController
- Redirects to billing page when subscription inactive OR no active agencies
- Admin::BillingController MUST skip this check (users need billing access to fix issues)
- Use `require_owner` before_action for owner-only actions (e.g., account settings)

### Controller Inheritance
- Admin controllers inherit from `Admin::BaseController`
- BillingController and other admin controllers get `current_agency`, `current_account` automatically
- RequestsController uses `current_agency.requests` for scoping

### Route Conventions
- Singular `resource` routes expect **plural** controller names
  - `resource :account` → `Admin::AccountsController` (not AccountController)
  - View folder: `app/views/admin/accounts/` (not account/)

## Signup & Billing Flow

### Registration (RegistrationsController)
Creates Account + Agency + User in transaction:
1. Create Account with `name` from agency name
2. Create Agency under Account with `phone_sms`, `active: true`
3. Create User under Account with `role: 'owner'`
4. Pass `account_id` in Stripe subscription metadata
5. On Stripe success, update Account with Stripe IDs
6. Auto-login user after successful signup

### Stripe Webhooks (StripeWebhooksController)
- Updates **Account** (not Agency) for billing events
- Find account by `stripe_subscription_id` or `metadata.account_id`
- `subscription.updated`: set `cancel_at_period_end` → status 'canceled'
- `invoice.payment_succeeded`: set status 'active'
- `invoice.payment_failed`: set status 'past_due'
- Use `OpenStruct` for mocking Stripe objects in tests

### Billing Controller
- Uses `current_account` for subscription info (@account.plan_name, etc.)
- Uses `current_agency` for agency-specific data (@agency.live_enabled, etc.)
- Stripe portal session uses `current_account.stripe_customer_id`

## Testing Conventions

### Fixtures
- accounts.yml: test accounts (reliable_group, acme_group)
- agencies.yml: agencies reference accounts via `account:` key
- users.yml: users reference accounts (not agencies) with roles
- clients.yml: clients have `phone_mobile` field
- **Fixture renames require updating ALL test file references**

### Common Patterns
- Use `agencies(:reliable)` not `Agency.first` when you need a specific agency
- Use `users(:john_owner)` for owner role, `users(:bob_admin)` for admin role
- When creating agencies in tests, create an Account first
- Use `OpenStruct.new(id: '...', status: '...')` for Stripe object mocks
- Use `.exists?(condition)` for efficient existence checks

### Seed Tests
- **Two duplicate files exist:** `seed_test.rb` AND `seeds_test.rb` - update both!
- Current expectations: 1 Account, 2 Agencies, 1 User (owner), 4 Clients, 10 Policies, 10 Documents

## Database & Environment

### Local Development
```bash
# Docker postgres config doesn't work outside container
# Use this for local development:
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://jward@localhost/covertext_test"
```

### Migration Patterns
- Use `foreign_key: true` and `null: false` for required associations
- Use `index: true` for frequently queried columns
- Use `unique: true` for columns that must be unique
- Stripe IDs: `unique: true, allow_nil: true` (unique when present, but optional)

### Common Issues
- Agency.has_many :users causes "agency_id does not exist" - users belong to Account
- When adding account_id to existing model, temporarily remove has_many until migration runs

## Do Not Add (Yet)
- AI, chatbots, or LLMs.
- HawkSoft CRM integration.
- Staff inboxes or manual approval workflows.
- Complex permission systems or over-engineered abstractions.

## Local Development
```bash
bin/setup
bin/dev
```

## Testing
```bash
bin/rails test              # Run all tests
bin/rails test:system       # Run system tests
bin/ci                      # Full CI suite (rubocop, brakeman, bundler-audit, importmap audit, tests)
```

## CI Expectations
- CI must be green before merging.
- GitHub Actions: CI → Publish Docker → Deploy (sequential)
- Security tools: Brakeman, bundler-audit, importmap audit must pass.
- All tests must pass (currently 202 tests).

## Deployment
- Kamal to production (see docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)
- Secrets from 1Password via service account token
- Keep secrets out of git; use Rails credentials and .kamal/secrets
- Docker images: `ghcr.io/workhorse-solutions/covertext` (lowercase required)

## Common Gotchas
- Always verify existing implementation before adding features (earlier stories may satisfy later ones)
- BillingController must skip subscription check so users can fix billing issues
- Helper methods exist for a reason - use them instead of duplicating query logic
- When PRD specifies new data model, update test expectations to match
- Check both seed test files when updating seed expectations

## Maintaining This Document

**This is a living document.** All AI agents working on CoverText should:

### Before Starting Work:
1. Read this file completely
2. Read `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for project overview
3. Check `tasks/progress.txt` for recent learnings

### While Working:
- When you discover a new pattern or solve a tricky issue, note it
- If you find incorrect information here, fix it immediately
- When you encounter a gotcha that cost you time, add it to "Common Gotchas"

### After Completing Work:
1. Update relevant sections with new patterns discovered
2. Add entry to `tasks/progress.txt` with:
   - What was implemented
   - Key learnings for future iterations
   - Files changed
3. If you created new conventions (controller patterns, model methods, etc.), document them

### What to Document:
- **Data model relationships** that aren't obvious from code
- **Controller/helper method patterns** that should be reused
- **Testing conventions** discovered through trial and error
- **Deployment/infrastructure gotchas** that caused issues
- **Database migration patterns** that worked well
- **Common mistakes** and their solutions

### Update Template:
When adding new information, use this structure:
```markdown
### [Section Name]
- [Specific pattern/rule]
- Why: [Reasoning or context]
- Example: [Code snippet or file reference]
```

**Goal:** Every agent after you should make fewer mistakes and move faster.
